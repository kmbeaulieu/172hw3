README for assignment 3.

Using Cloud9 as an IDE for node is really neat. 
I can push my code from here and as long as I don't need server stuff from amazon I am good. 
I could use it from cloud9, but it requires different ports to fiddle with and get right that are different than what we did in class.

Things that don't work:
Everything.
There is an error that says util.inherits is not a function.
Maybe circular requirements? need to look into it more.
